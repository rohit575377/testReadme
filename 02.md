Aapka project "RY ShipChain" hai, jo MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack pe bana hoga. Aapne mention kiya hai ki aapko 2 servers chahiye, ek production aur ek staging ke liye, aur 2 repos bhi (ek frontend ke liye aur ek backend ke liye). Saath hi aapko Git workflow, strategies aur Netlify per deployment steps chahiye.

Chaliye, sab kuch step by step samajhate hain:

### 1. Project Structure and Naming Convention
- **Frontend repo (React app)**:
  - **Repo name**: `ry-shipchain-frontend`
  - **Folder structure**:
    ```
    ry-shipchain-frontend/
      â”œâ”€â”€ public/
      â”œâ”€â”€ src/
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
      â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
      â”œâ”€â”€ .env
      â””â”€â”€ README.md
    ```

- **Backend repo (Node.js + Express API)**:
  - **Repo name**: `ry-shipchain-backend`
  - **Folder structure**:
    ```
    ry-shipchain-backend/
      â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
      â”œâ”€â”€ models/
      â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
      â”œâ”€â”€ services/
      â”œâ”€â”€ .env
      â”œâ”€â”€ server.js
      â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
      â””â”€â”€ README.md
    ```

### 2. Git Workflow and Strategies

**Git Workflow**:
- **Branching strategy**: Git flow will work best here.
    - **`main` branch**: This will contain the stable production-ready code.
    - **`develop` branch**: This will have the latest feature and bug fixes, essentially the staging code.
    - **Feature branches**: Each new feature or bug fix should have its own branch. For example:
      - `feature/shipments-tracking`
      - `feature/user-authentication`
    - **Release branches**: Once the feature is ready, merge it into `develop` and test. When everything is stable, merge `develop` into `main`.

**Git Flow**:
1. Start by cloning both repos:
   - `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ry-shipchain-frontend.git`
   - `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ry-shipchain-backend.git`

2. For both repos:
   - Checkout the `develop` branch and start working on features.
   - When a feature is complete, commit changes and push them to the respective repo and branch.
   - Merge feature branches into `develop` after PR review.
   - Once testing is done, merge `develop` into `main` for deployment.

**Git Strategy Example**:
- `frontend` repo:
  - `main` (production)
  - `develop` (staging)
  - `feature/*` (feature branches like `feature/login`, `feature/shipments`)

- `backend` repo:
  - `main` (production)
  - `develop` (staging)
  - `feature/*` (feature branches like `feature/order-api`, `feature/inventory-api`)

### 3. Deployment Strategy on Netlify

**Frontend Deployment (React app)**:
- Netlify will host your frontend (React) application.

**Steps**:
1. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), log in, and click on "New site from Git".
2. Choose the **`ry-shipchain-frontend`** repo from GitHub (or GitLab).
3. Select **Branch**: `main` for production, and `develop` for staging (if you want a separate environment for staging).
4. **Build settings**:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `build/`
5. Click on **Deploy site**.

**Backend Deployment**:
- For the backend, you might consider using a service like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean, as Netlify doesn't directly host Node.js servers.

For **Heroku**:
1. Install Heroku CLI and log in:
   ```
   heroku login
   ```
2. Create a new app on Heroku:
   ```
   heroku create ry-shipchain-backend
   ```
3. Add the remote to your backend repo:
   ```
   git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/ry-shipchain-backend.git
   ```
4. Push the code to Heroku:
   ```
   git push heroku main
   ```
5. Your backend will be deployed and live on a Heroku URL.

**Environment Variables**:
- For both production and staging, make sure to configure environment variables such as `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, and any other configurations in your `.env` files.
- **For Netlify** (frontend), go to "Site settings" > "Build & Deploy" > "Environment", and add your environment variables like `REACT_APP_API_URL` (pointing to the backend API).
- **For Heroku** (backend), configure environment variables through:
  ```
  heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_uri
  ```

### 4. Netlify Production vs Staging
- For **staging**: After pushing your changes to the `develop` branch, you can deploy it to a separate environment on Netlify.
  - Go to your Netlify dashboard, select the site, and go to "Deploys".
  - You can set up a deploy hook for staging as well.

- For **production**: Once everything is ready and tested, merge your changes to the `main` branch in both frontend and backend repos, and it will automatically deploy to your live site.

### Final Notes:
- Make sure to write meaningful commit messages and regularly pull changes from `develop` to avoid merge conflicts.
- Set up GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipelines for automatic testing and deployments to streamline your workflow.
